# Tic Tac Toe
**Developed in Unity**  
*This is our submission for the AI Assignment where we had to create Tic Tac Toe which took advantage of the MinMax algorithm and after that applied pruning to the AI's choices.*

**Project Structure:**
* All scripts are inside the Assets -> Scripts folder.
* Inside the scripts folder we've diviced our scripts up in 2.
  * One for the game (TicTacToe)
  * One for the main menu (MainMenu)
  
Feel free to light up Unity and import the project if needed. If you want to test it out in the browser, head over to http://zakeovich.dk/games/tictactoe/index.html
